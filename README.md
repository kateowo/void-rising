# Void Rising Datapack for Minecraft 1.17

A lightweight data-pack for Minecraft Java Edition 1.16 that well, makes the void rise. Everything is controlled within the single datapack with customisable variables for timings if needed. Lag is handled well with falling blocks being killed to avoid sand blocks causing lag upon rising. Upon dying, you are automatically placed into spectator mode to allow you to watch the game in progress without interference.

## Featuring

* **Customisable timings**: Using scoreboards you can configure event timings to fit your liking.
* **Sectioned game**: The game is structured into 3 segments; the starter, grace and main period.
* **Dead spectators**: Once out of the grace period, dead players are automatically spectating.
* **Height limiting**: Upon the void reaching y245, it's up to the players to fight to the death and steal the victory.
* **Reduced clutter**: Status messages can be swapped between bossbar, actionbar or just disabled along with all sound effects.
* **Handled lag**: To ensure the game runs smooth all the time, all falling blocks are automatically killed.
* **Easy to use**: All events related to the void rising can be easily paused and reset in a new location if needed.
